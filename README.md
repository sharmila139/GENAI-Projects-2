# GENAI-Projects-2

# GenAI Mini Projects & Use-Cases with LangChain and More

Welcome to this repository.  
It contains a collection of small, hands-on projects and experiments built around Generative AI, LangChain, Streamlit, HuggingFace, and related technologies. Each project focuses on a specific use-case, tool integration, or concept.

## What's Inside?

This repo showcases the application of several powerful tools and ideas through mini projects:

### 1. Text Summarization with LangChain
Generate concise and informative summaries from large text documents using LangChain-powered LLMs.

### 2. Text-to-Math Problem Solver
Converts natural language math questions into solvable equations and provides step-by-step answers using LLMs.

### 3. HuggingFace + LangChain Integration
Demonstrates how to use pre-trained models from HuggingFace with LangChain agents and chains for various NLP tasks.

### 4. PDF Querying (RAHG) with LangChain + AstraDB
Implements Retrieve-Act-Generate (RAHG) pipelines to query PDFs using LangChain and store chunked embeddings in AstraDB (Vector DB).

### 5. Multilanguage Code Assistant using CodeLlama
An interactive assistant that helps you write, fix, and explain code in multiple programming languages using CodeLlama.

### 6. Deployment of GenAI Apps
Examples of how to deploy GenAI projects to:
- Streamlit
- HuggingFace Spaces
